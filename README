hxPlugin
========

Is a neko plugin for the Geany IDE (http://geany.uvena.de)

The geany neko plugin does 2 things:

1. Provides a haXe interface to the Geany plugin API.
2. Provides code completion for haXe via the haxe --display

1 & 2 are working but I haven't got the entire Geany API done yet.


NOTE TO (Gentoo) x64 USERS
==========================

This is what I had to do to get plugin compiled and running properly 
on 64 bit Gentoo linux. Make sure you have boehm-gc 6.8 installed. 
I tried all day with 7.0 but it keeps segfaulting on me.

1. Get geany svn source
2. CFLAGS="[Your CFLAGS from /etc/make.conf] -fPIC" LDFLAGS="[Your LDFLAGS from /etc/make.conf]" ./autogen
   (make sure you don't forget LDFLAGS if you use stuff like hashstyle=gnu)
   (CFLAGS are probably optional but I believe -fPIC is important for 64bit. At least it works here :-)
3. Edit build_plugin script, and set proper paths
4. sh ./build_plugin
5. voila!
